# Java Implementation

The pdf with instructions was right on the Java line count.  I believe I've accomplished the task in slightly less than 350 lines.

I won't speak to the economy of the thing, but it does do the task (correctly as far as I know, I don't do testing for free. ;-)).


    #!/usr/bin/bash
  
    echo "You need a montage!"
